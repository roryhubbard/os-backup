- slide 25
- The MAEM is given a minimum degree and a time scale constraint as part of the
  mission definition.
  - A subset of agents can coordinate – for sim 2 coordination is done by
    electing a leader (using UUIDs) and having the leader solve the assignment
    problem for all agents. 
- The SAEM is given a communications aware task which contains a combination of
  rendezvous behaviors and other behaviors (e.g. area coverage, target follow).
  - Component responsible for determining which behavior is currently active 
  - We are primarily focused on balancing rendezvous tasks with a ‘primary’ task
- The BM is given a specific behavior to execute and provides an API for
  estimating completion time.
  - For sim 2 our primary focus is to extend our sim 1 rendezvous behavior so it
    can be interleaved with other behaviors.  This will involve predicting where
    the robot will be in the future (according to the current behavior), and
    then selecting a rendezvous point that will be convenient for both agents
    near that time
  - The second focus for sim 2 behaviors is bearing based search
- The MM provides a Dubins path oracle that helps the BM refine time estimates
  for a given path

5) Motion Manager

- slide 26
- dubins path planner
- motion manager is an oracle for estimating completion time of a path
- In order to profit from the ~5dB gain of the dipole antennas at 0 elevation,
  we need motion manager to coordinate wing dips (a form of formation flight)

6) Behavior Manager
https://aiformaneuver.sharepoint.us/:p:/s/AFWERXSWARM/EbQXyKC-Io5KomvSUrUMQGUBzTV1teTd531Hl7KgCaidJA?e=M4GHpr&wdOrigin=TEAMS-WEB.p2p.p2p&wdExp=TEAMS-CONTROL&wdhostclicktime=1699900899398&web=1
- slide 27
- Comms Anchor (from sim 1): we can expand to support relay/intermittent link
  with the GCS; multiple jammers
- Comms Relay (from sim 1): we can expand to support > 2 neighbors
- Rendezvous (new for sim 2): Given another agent ID, travel to an established
  rendezvous location. Requires always maintaining AHAs with other agents in the
  team. Closely related to comms relay.
- Understanding the expected execution time of a behavior is essential for
  balancing communications objectives with primary objectives.

7) SAEM
https://aiformaneuver.sharepoint.us/:p:/s/AFWERXSWARM/EbQXyKC-Io5KomvSUrUMQGUBzTV1teTd531Hl7KgCaidJA?e=M4GHpr&wdOrigin=TEAMS-WEB.p2p.p2p&wdExp=TEAMS-CONTROL&wdhostclicktime=1699900899398&web=1
- slide 28
- Given a rendezvous behavior, an agent ID with which to maintain communications
  and a maximum window for communications drop, alternate between execution of
  the Task subtree and the rendezvous behavior. This is a new subtree to be
  optionally added to existing Tasks subtrees.

8) MAEM
https://aiformaneuver.sharepoint.us/:p:/s/AFWERXSWARM/EbQXyKC-Io5KomvSUrUMQGUBzTV1teTd531Hl7KgCaidJA?e=M4GHpr&wdOrigin=TEAMS-WEB.p2p.p2p&wdExp=TEAMS-CONTROL&wdhostclicktime=1699900899398&web=1
- slide 29
- The MAEM is responsible for making and coordinating decisions at the team
  level. Given the communications constraint (e.g. minimum degree over a time
  period), subgraph membership, and a task pool the MAEM assigns agents to tasks
  with rendezvous tasks that ensure connectivity over a time window
- Start with a heuristic based implementation (gets us off the ground easy to
  implement) but push toward a mixed-integer program formulation (e.g. VRPTW) in
  phase 2.
- Start with nominating a leader to solve the problem (phases 1 and 2) and move
  toward a fully distributed solution (e.g. auction) in phase 3.

9) RF Emitter Sensing and Tracking
  - Develop sensor models with fidelity targeted to enable realistic track
    uncertainty models, leveraging mature GFI (e.g., AFSIM) 
  - Inform and execute common HME Object Tracking software development based on
    Swarm tracking requirements 
  - Create custom emitter tracking-related components as-needed for the Swarm
    effort 
  - To enable emitter localization behaviors, each agent will be equipped with a
    low-cost ES sensor that detects RF emissions and estimates emitter signal
    parameters. The ES measurements are be fed into a multi-agent Object Tracker
    that fuses the measurements to produce emitter tracks. Finally, the emitter
    tracks are made available to the Mapping and Behavior algorithms which will
    plan against and optimize those emitter track uncertainties
  - EMS emitters are ground-based and stationary
  - Simulated ESM sensor data will be high-quality (e.g., 100% probability of
    detection, infinite resolution, no false alarms, no bias, no actual noise,
    etc.)
  - Simulated ESM sensors will report an emitter ID for unambiguous association
  - GTSAM ISAM2 library


10) Eventually we want to let the data show how many aircraft we would need i.e.
  can we establish a comms link with X amount of birds. Theres a value curve
  about adding more aircraft. Would like to have a tool to calculate that.

I think a representative set of dimensions that meets the customer intent here
is probably something like 30nm between the FLOT and the first line of jammers,
with a operational area "width" of maybe 50nm (25nm left and right of the launch
point). I'd expect that for "second order" targets, that could extend to maybe
50nm.
